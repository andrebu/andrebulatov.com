My thoughts on Islam:

## 1. Islam is not a race

Islam is not a [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(biology)).  I think today's climate makes that worth repeating.  

Islam is not a race.  Islam is a [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion).  

Whether the "islamic community of the world" is racially (ethnically) homogenous or not, criticizing beliefs or practices of people who identify themselves as "Muslim," is not racism, no matter how you [argue it](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-considine/muslims-are-not-a-race_b_8591660.html).

I'll update my thoughts as the urge arises.
