Profile
=======

My personal website and blog, titled "Profile," for now at least.

----

##To Do

1. Upload site
2. Re-organize template files into header, footer, and main pages, etc
3. Make sure I appear as author on Google Search results
4. Rename site from "Less" to "Profile"
5. Put Github project link on page or in footer
6. Complete the 2-navbar system.  Consider moving both buttons into 1 nav container for mobile and also float them to opposite sides.
7. Setup "Blog/Recent Articles" section on main page
8. Much much more...
9. [Good example](http://smarchal.com/) of the kind of nav I want for main nav
10. Add "Causes I Support" section
11. Fix Firefox CSS for .jumbotron mobile height of img
12. Reduce style.css to under 1000 lines (shoud be easy) 
13. Add OpenName and Flattr to Wallet
14. Add "copy to cliboard" onClick function for crypto wallet addresses
15. Post some articles (ie., cable map or agile manifesto or else)
16.

##Inspiration

- [Less Theme](http://lessmade.com/themes/less/) - a minimalist WordPress theme by [Jared Errickson](http://jarederickson.com/)

- [Pascal van Gemert's Interactive Resume](http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/abilities) - I pretty much copied this whole static page at first in order to learn and practice adapting static HTML to a PHP WordPress theme.  After I finished the basic transfer, I added a bunch of features, changed around some fonts and colors, and I am continuing to edit it with time.

##From Old, "Less" README.md

Less
====

A simple minimal WordPress theme built with only what is needed to survive

![Less screenshot](https://github.com/alliswell/Less/blob/master/dev/less-screenshot.png?raw=true)

Less is a super minimal theme, both front end and back end. adding no bloat whatesover. It only uses the minimum requirements that WordPress has, a stylesheet, screenshot and the index page. 

I did use LESS (http://lesscss.org/) for all the styles, if you know how to use it you will be able to change a few viarables to customize the site with no problem!

We also used JSLint'ed JavaScript to make sure it's the squeky-cleanest JavaScript your brain can imagine. It's also minified using [JSMin](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html) so it's small, but if you like reading minified JavaScript, then this is just for you.

Finally, the theme has been localized so if you dislike English or want to read these posts in another language, you can translate it!
